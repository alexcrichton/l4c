Lab 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

For lab 2 we implemented control statements for L2. These included if, for,
while, break, and continue. The major parts of our compiler that had to change
were the initialization checking, return checking, parsing, IR, and assembly
translation. We also decided to add neededness analysis to our compiler for L2.
