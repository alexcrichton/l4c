clarify private semantics:
  - can subclass access parent private fields?
protected semantics?
  - does protected just mean that a subclass can access parent protected fields?

shadowing:
  - parameters/local variables should be able to shadow class instance
    variables?

overloading
static fields/functions
  - maybe just functions

super
